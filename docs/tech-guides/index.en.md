# Where can I find technical guides and documentation?

In addition to basic issues relating to agriculture-specific research data management (RDM), FAIRagro also deals with more **technical aspects**.
These developments are taking place in FAIRagro Task Areas 3 (Standardization, Interoperability and Quality) and 4 (Infrastructure Services).  
You can find an overview of FAIRagro services [here](../services.md) in our Knowledge Base or on our [website](https://fairagro.net/services){:target="_blank"}.


## Technical Guides
One of the most important topics in the area of “FAIR RDM” is **metadata**.  
*Which core metadata set is recommended by FAIRagro and how can it be implemented?* &rarr; [Core Metadata Specification](core_metadata_specification.md)

A more basic introduction to metadata can be found here:  
*What can I do in practice (even without much prior knowledge) to document data/collect metadata?* &rarr; [Practical Guide Metadata](../rdm/metadata_guide.md)


## Detailed Documentations
Some services are intuitive to use.
For others, **detailed documentation of the available features and parameters** is useful.
The [SciWIn-Client](../services.md#sciwin-client) is one of the more complex services developed by FAIRagro.  
*What options does the SciWIn-Client offer me?* &rarr; [SciWIn-Client Dokumentation](https://fairagro.github.io/sciwin/getting-started/){:target="_blank"}
